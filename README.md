Kaggle Titanic Competition : Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model Building

## Project Motivation: ##

This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Submission

The Titanic disaster is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. The Titanic sunk in the icy North Atlantic waters after colliding with an iceberg. This devastating incident took lives of more than 1500 out of 2200 passengers. Lots of death was because of shortage of lifeboats and the lack of satisfactory emergency procedures.
I wanted to explore the data to understand the factors impacting the survival and see whether i could predict the survival using machine learning model:

1. Does the survival or death depend on the gender?
2. Does travelling alone or travelling together helped for survival?
3. Does traveling in different Passenger classes have an impact on survival?
4. Does Fare have an impact on survival?
